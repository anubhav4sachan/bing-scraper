 # Bing Scraper

The bingscraper is python3 package which extracts the text and images content on search engine `bing.com`.

It helps the user in a way that he/she will be getting only meaningful results and images for their search query. It does not download the ad content and hence saving data for the user.

The script working in background requests for a search term and creates directory (if not made previously) in the root directory of the script where all the content of the related particular search is stored. This script will be downloading the hypertext and hyperlink to that text and saving it to a .txt file within the directory made by itself. This directory saves the text content as well as the images downloaded using the script.

    c. `os`: For checking and making directories.
    
    d. `PIL.Image`: `Pillow Module`. For extracting image content.
    
    e. `io.ByteIO`: For saving the extracted image using the `PIL.Image`.
